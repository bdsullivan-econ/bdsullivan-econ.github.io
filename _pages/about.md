I’m a PhD economist at the U.S. Census Bureau, where I lead the development of the wealth and retirement account content for the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP). I specialize in using survey data to explore economic well-being—especially wage and wealth inequality—and I’m passionate about helping others make sense of complex data.

Whether I’m designing survey questions on retirement savings, answering data user inquiries, or writing documentation to support researchers, I enjoy bridging the gap between raw data and real-world insights. My strengths lie in diving deep into datasets, crafting clear and compelling descriptive analyses, and ensuring that data users can find and understand the information they need.
