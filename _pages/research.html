							Abstract
						</summary>
						<p>
							We study the role of job transitions and firm pay policies in the Black-White earnings gap in the US. We use administrative data for the universe of employer-employee matches from 2005-2019 to analyze worker mobility in a general but tractable framework, which allows for firm effects that depend on workers’ job history. Using differences in average pay between origin and destination firms as the treatment intensity of a job move, we analyze transitions up and down the job ladder and estimate race-specific passthrough rates of average firm pay into a mover’s own earnings. First, we find race-specific asymmetry around the direction of the move, whereby losses experienced in downward transitions are meaningfully larger than gains from upward transitions with a similar treatment intensity. For a $1 earnings increase in transitions up the job ladder, earnings passthroughs in transitions down the job ladder impose an earnings loss of $1.25 among White workers and $1.50 among Black workers. Second, we uncover career setbacks as a novel pathway in the evolution of racial earnings gaps. In transitions down the job ladder, Black workers lose an additional $0.24 for every $1 decrease in White workers’ earnings, a finding which prevails across sex and age. This “racial penalty” is not driven by differential pay, as it is completely absent when Black and White workers move between the same firm pairs. Instead, the penalty is due to differential sorting following career setbacks, so that Black workers regain employment in “worse” jobs, with strong evidence for racial differences in access to short-run liquidity as a mechanism. Overall, our findings offer a robust and computationally simple framework for modeling earnings determination processes and have implications for safety-net policies in the American labor market.

						Abstract

						What determined the corporate use of credit lines in the recent financial crisis? To address this question we hand-collect data on credit lines and interest rate hedging for a random sample of 600 COMPUSTAT firms. We document that drawdowns of credit lines had already increased in 2007, earlier than what previous work has found. The surge in drawdowns occurred precisely when disruptions in bank funding markets began. In addition, we distinguish unused and available portions of credit lines, which we then use to disentangle credit supply and credit demand effects. On the supply side, we find covenant-induced reduction of credit supply to be small, and almost no evidence of credit line cancellations. On the demand side, our results confirm that while smaller and lower-rated firms use their credit lines more intensively in general, larger and higher-rated firms were more likely to draw on their credit lines during the crisis. We find that firms that use interest rate swaps to hedge the interest rate risk associated with their credit lines draw down significantly more from those lines than non-hedged firms.

							This paper uses data from the Criminal Justice Administrative Records Systems linked with survey and administrative data sources from the U.S. Census Bureau to provide the first evidence on the looming retirement crisis stemming from the aging generations of Americans who have been increasingly impacted by criminal justice policies like mass incarceration. First, we measure the share of current retirees with criminal records, and provide projections of how these rates among retiring cohorts will increase through 2050. We find that approximately 10% of men at age 62 have faced a felony criminal charge, and this will grow by 70% over the next two decades, peaking among cohorts retiring around 2040. Second, we characterize the living circumstances of those with criminal histories approaching retirement. In spite of almost a decade of criminal desistance on average, this population exhibits serious economic vulnerability, higher disability rates, and greater detachment from kinship networks, factors that put these individuals at risk in retirement. Current data indicate a growing reliance on safety net programs such as the Supplemental Security Income program, for which eligibility does not depend on work history.

				<li>“A Replication: Selection, Investment, and Women’s Relative Wages Over Time”</li>
					<ul style="list-style-type:none;">

								Abstract
							</summary>
							<p>
								In this paper, I replicate and extend on Mulligan and Rubinstein (2008), “Selection, Investment, and Women’s Relative Wages Over Time,” which finds that women’s selection into the full-time fullyear labor force shifts from negative in the late 1970s to positive in the late 1990s. Consequently, the authors suggest that changing selection appears to drive the narrowing of the observed gender wage gap. These results, however, are obtained using CPS data, which is only representative for a subset of the U.S. population; the CPS fails to include individuals living in group quarters. Therefore, I extend on their work in two ways: (1) replicating the Heckman two-step and identification at infinity methods using Census data and (2) changing how male selection is modeled in identification at infinity to account for recent declines in male labor force participation. Overall, my results largely confirm the findings of Mulligan and Rubinstein (2008). Namely, estimating the Heckman twostep model using the Census continues to suggest that after controlling for female selection into the full-time full-year labor force, the estimated gender wage gap is relatively constant over time. Compared to the results obtained using the CPS, when I use the Census to estimate the gender wage gap among males and females with high predicted labor force attachment, I find that despite differences in point estimates, the selection-corrected gender wage gap narrows less relative to the observed wage gap, such that female selection into the full-time full-year labor force helps explain the observed convergence.

			  <li>“The Effects of Presumptive Sentencing Worksheets in Alabama”</li>

								Abstract
							</summary>
							<p>
								In October 2006, Alabama began using voluntary sentencing guidelines for a select group of property, drug, burglary, and violent offenses. In October 2013, the guidelines for property and drug offenses became presumptive, or mandatory except for extenuating circumstances. The guidelines were meant to reduce the use of incarceration or, if incarcerated, the sentence length for non-violent offenders. Using the National Corrections Reporting Program (NCRP), I find that sentence length for property and drug offenses affected by the guidelines fell after 2013, particularly for Black offenders. I also find that the variation in sentence length for affected offenses decreased for Black and White offenders alike.

								This paper presents a descriptive analysis of the differential impacts of AB 109 (or Realignment) and Proposition 47 across California’s counties. In October 2011, California implemented Realignment, which shifted the supervision responsibility for low-level offenders from the state to the county-level. Yet, there is no statistically significant relationship between the percent change in the prison and jail incarceration rates following AB 109. Then in November 2014, California implemented Proposition 47, which re-classified low-level felonies as misdemeanors and therefore reduced the jail population. Overall, this paper finds that the fiscal impact of AB 109 may have been the largest for lower-income counties, with little evidence suggesting that Proposition 47 mitigated the fiscal impacts of AB 109 among these low-income counties.

			"The Effects of Restrictions on Public Assistance"
			<ul style="list-style-type:none;">

						Abstract
					</summary>
					<p>
						In 1996, the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act (PRWORA) instituted a lifetime ban on participation in Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) and Supplemental Nutritional Assistance program (SNAP) for individuals with felony drug convictions. However, the policy gave states the ability to opt out of or modify the ban on government benefits. Using the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) and the monthly Current Population Survey (CPS), this paper seeks to analyze the effects of opting out of the ban on food stamp receipt and the benefit amount received by families of former drug felony offenders. While benefits are not denied to the entire household, household size – which is used to calculate the benefit amount – will fall for each member who was convicted of a drug felony. Furthermore, PRWORA was meant to encourage marriage while reducing dependence on government benefits. Because there are mixed results regarding its success, this paper seeks to study the relationship between states opting out of the federal ban on public assistance and marriage patterns among welfare-eligible recipients.

		“Do High Caseloads Increase the Impact of Parole Board Budget Cuts?”
		<ul style="list-style-type:none;">
				<details>
					<summary>
						Abstract
					</summary>
					<p>
						In Fiscal Year 2010, the funding for the Alabama Board of Pardons and Paroles fell from $50.8 million to $45.9 million. At the same time, the share of offenders receiving parole within a year of prison admission fell by 28.5 percent for individuals incarcerated for drug offenses. Other than a decline in funding, there were no changes to drug laws or sentence lengths. However, Alabama’s bordering states also received less funding around 2010, but did not experience a decline in the share of inmates granted parole. One difference that stands out between Alabama and its bordering states is Alabama’s high caseload – on average, a parole officer in Alabama supervises about 190 individuals, whereas parole officers in Tennessee and Georgia supervise less than 90 individuals. This paper aims to investigate whether there is a relationship between parole board funding and caseload such that fewer individuals are released on parole. I also want to determine why drug offenders appear to be the most affected.
